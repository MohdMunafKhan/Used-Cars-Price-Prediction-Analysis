# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction-Analysis

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the project is to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features, allowing buyers and sellers to make informed decisions. the project addresses the challenge of understanding the impact of car features on its market value, helping to streamline pricing strategies.

## Overview of the Project
This project applies data analysis and statistical methods to predict the selling price of used cars. It leverages Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Spicy for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical testing. Key statistical tests, such as ANOVA, f-test, and p-value calculation, are performed to evaluate feature significance. Descriptive analysis explores the dataset and identifies trends, correlations, and patterns.
By modeling the relationship between car features (e.g., make, model, age, mileage, condition) and their prices, the project delivers actionable and valuable insights for stakeholders in the used car market.
